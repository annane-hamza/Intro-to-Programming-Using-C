## âœ… Exercise 1: Define and Print Variables

### Description:

Define the following variables:

- A variable `a` with the value `3`
- A variable `b` with the value `5`
- A variable `sum` which holds the sum of `a` and `b`
- A string variable `sentence` with the value `"the sum is: "`

Then print them all in a clean format.

### Expected Output:

```
the sum is: 8
```

## âœ… Exercise 2: Less Code (No `sum` or `sentence`)

### Description:

Rewrite **Exercise 1**, but **without declaring the **``** and **``** variables**.\
Print the result directly in the `printf` statement.

### Expected Output:

```
the sum is: 8
```

## âœ… Exercise 3: Sum of Two Numbers (User Input)

### Description:

Ask the user to enter two numbers, then calculate and display their sum.

### Example Input/Output:

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 15
The sum is: 25
```

## âœ… Exercise 4: User Information Form

### Description:

Ask the user to enter their:

- Name
- Job
- Age

Then display the entered information in a well-organized format.

### Example Input/Output:

```
Enter your name: Hamza
Enter your job: Developer
Enter your age: 22

--- User Information ---
Name : Hamza
Job  : Developer
Age  : 22
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Beginners:

- Use `#include <stdio.h>` for input/output.
- Use `int` for numbers and `char[]` for strings.
- Use `scanf` to get user input.
- Use `printf` to display output.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
