# Intro to Programming Using C and Logic Building

Welcome to my programming journey! ðŸš€

This repository documents my learning and progress in programming fundamentals using the C language, focusing on building strong logic and problem-solving skills. Whether you are a beginner or want to follow along with my learning path, youâ€™ll find exercises, explanations, and projects that showcase how to think like a programmer from scratch.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- **Logic building exercises** â€” puzzles and problems that sharpen your algorithmic thinking  
- **Projects and practice challenges** â€” small programs that put your knowledge to the test

## Why C?

C is a foundational programming language that helps you understand how computers work at a low level. Mastering C gives you a solid base for learning other languages and diving deeper into software development, embedded systems, and systems programming.

## My Learning Goals

- Gain confidence writing clean, efficient C code  
- Develop strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills  
- Prepare for advanced programming topics and real-world projects
